# Predicting E-Commerce Customer Behavior

Every day there are more and more companies selling their products online versus in brick-and-mortar stores.  These companies collect data on their customers' behavior purchasing products and services online.  This data is very valuable to companies.  They analyze this data to acquire insights on their customers' buying behavior patterns.  The analysis will provide leverage to the company by creating new strategies to market customers.  In this project, I will use e-commerce data provided by a company in Turkey to predict the buying patterns of customers.  I will use machine learning to create a predictive model.  This model will use customers' attributes to predict whether a visitor/customer will make a purchase or not.
